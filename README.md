# RL_Blackjack

Blackjack is a popular casino game, of which the objective is to get a
better hand than the dealer without busting. The goal of this project is to
investigate and compare two different Reinforcement learning techniques
for approximating the optimal strategy. Reinforcement learning
approaches has proven to be very effective in stochastic environments, and
especially in Blackjack, as they are able to exploit the gamesâ€™ inherent
reward structure. This is the final project in the course "Autonomous and Adaptive Systems" at the University of Bologna, spring, 2022.

Details about the method and results obtained can be found in the project report in this repository! Happy reading :D
